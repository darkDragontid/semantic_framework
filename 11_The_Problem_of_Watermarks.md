#### The Problem of Watermarks

The Principle of Semantic Purity and Incompatibility with Watermarks/

The use of commercial LLM providers that employ invisible watermarks (steganographic markers) is fundamentally incompatible with the system's architecture for the following reasons:

- Data Pollution: Watermarks introduce uncontrolled noise into semantic tags (theme, focus, related), distorting their machine-readable purity and violating the principle of consistency.

- Undermining Integrity: Hidden markers, intended for attribution purposes rather than conveying meaning, make it impossible to build a reliable semantic knowledge graph.

- Loss of Sovereignty: The knowledge base becomes dependent on the algorithms and policies of third-party corporations, which contradicts the principle of the user's architectural control over their data.

To preserve the system's integrity, it is recommended to use either open local models or to use commercial AI exclusively at peripheral stages of work (e.g., generating drafts) with subsequent independent semantic tagging.
