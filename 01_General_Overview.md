## General Overview

This tagging system is a method of semantic decomposition that transforms unstructured text from personal notes into a machine-readable hierarchy of semantic units; is a formalized mechanism for transforming unstructured text into a machine-readable ontology of personal knowledge through the architectural distribution of semantic roles and differential strictness of tag formation. Its goal is to overcome the limitations of flat tags and rigid hierarchies, providing a foundation for deep analysis and automatic processing of thoughts.

#### The system consists of the following field groups:

- Fundamental Classifiers (domain, category)

- Interpretation Core (theme/focus, related)

- Semantic Descriptors (keywords, operation, emotion, context) - describes content, actions, and circumstances.

- Utilitarian-Service Fields (meta_context (note creation context), action (task management), components (machine decomposition)).

This system was originally designed for symbiosis with artificial intelligence, acting as a "thought-machine" interface. The high complexity of the structure is justified by the fact that the main load of semantic analysis and field pre-filling falls on the AI, while the user's role is reduced to curation and verification. 
_(for more details, see the section "Implementation and Modes of Operation")_

#### The key principle is that complexity is not eliminated but tamed through the architectural distribution of tasks among fields. This ensures:

- Reusability of tags as standardized building blocks.

- Semantic clarity of each concept.

- Dual optimization: a balance between human flexibility and machine strictness.

_(This principle is detailed in the "Fundamental Principle" section)_

Positioning and Target Audience. The system is intended for researchers, writers, philosophers, and analysts working with complex information landscapes. It does not replace but semantically enriches existing methodologies (PARA, Zettelkasten), focusing on working with insights, analysis, and reasoning.

The Essence of the Approach: The system shifts the focus from the question "where to put it?" to questions of interpretation: "How to understand it?" (through theme/focus), "What to do?" (operation), "How do I feel?" (emotion), and "What is it related to?" (related).
This system is a formalized mechanism for transforming unstructured text into a machine-readable ontology of personal knowledge through the architectural distribution of semantic roles and differential strictness of tag formation.

This tagging system can be defined as a Structured Interpretative Framework for AI-Human Symbiosis.

_(This framework is designed for AI-human symbiosis. Its creation, including the refinement and translation of this documentation, is a practical example of this collaboration in action.)_
