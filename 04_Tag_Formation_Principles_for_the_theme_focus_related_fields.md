### Tag Formation Principles for the theme, focus, related fields

These principles are a direct implementation of the meta-principle of Architectural Distribution of Complexity and ensure the creation of machine-readable semantic units.

#### 1. Principle of Formal Purity

Essence: A tag must be a pure abstraction, free from grammatical relations and contextual noise.

Requirement: Use of nouns and adjectives only. Verbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and demonstrative words are prohibited.

#### 2. Principle of Composite Compactness

Essence: A tag must form a single, holistic concept, not a simple enumeration.

Requirement: Format: Adjective_Noun or Noun_Noun. Limited to 2-3 words.

Goal: Ensuring semantic density and avoiding descriptive phrases.

#### 3. Principle of Contextual Independence

Essence: The meaning of a tag must be self-sufficient and interpretable outside of the specific note.

Requirement: Pronouns, demonstrative words ("this," "that"), and references to context known only to the author are prohibited.

Goal: Ensuring the tag's reusability across different contexts and its unambiguous machine-readability.

#### 4. Principle of Normalization via Dynamic Dictionary

Essence: To ensure consistency, user input (synonyms, abbreviations) must be converted to a canonical form.

Requirement: Use of the canonical tag form (e.g., artificial_intelligence) for storage, analysis, and establishing connections. Synonyms (AI, AI) are used only at the input stage and are converted by the assistant.

Goal: Resolving synonym conflict and preventing semantic blurring of the knowledge base.
