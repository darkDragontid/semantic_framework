### Philosophy of Interaction

This system is a practical application of a set of universal principles for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs). These principles were derived empirically during its creation and form its ideological core.

#### 1. General Principles of Interaction with LLMs

**1.1. Principle of a Clear System:** An LLM is a processor, not an oracle. The quality of its response is directly dependent on the clarity of the task and the definitiveness of the required response format.

**1.2. Principle of Iterative Refinement:** Interaction with AI is a dialogue, not a request. The first response is a draft that requires polishing and rethinking by a human.

**1.3. Principle of Role Distribution:** The human, as the strategist, defines the direction and critically evaluates the result. The AI, as the tactician, processes data, structures it, and generates options.

**1.4. Principle of Contextual Saturation:** The depth and accuracy of an LLM's response are proportional to the volume and quality of the context provided.

**1.5. Principle of Explication:** The power of AI lies in its ability to translate vague human intuitive guesses into explicit, formalized concepts and connections.

#### 2. Implementation of Principles in This System

**2.1. System as an Interface:** The tagging system, with its strict fields and rules, is the implementation of the Principle of a Clear System. It gives the AI an unambiguous instruction: "Analyze any text using this template."

**2.2. Verification Cycle:** The process where the AI suggests tag options and the user verifies and corrects them is the implementation of the Principle of Iterative Refinement.

**2.3. Architectural Division of Labor:** The distribution of tasks (human-curator, AI-analyzer) and the complexity levels of the fields is the implementation of the Principle of Role Distribution.

**2.4. Dynamic Dictionary as Context:** The mechanism that stores the history of tags and their connections provides the AI with rich context for analyzing new notes, implementing the Principle of Contextual Saturation.

**2.5. `relate` and `interpretation` Fields as Tools of Explication:** These fields are specifically designed to identify and capture non-obvious, implicit connections, which is a direct implementation of the Principle of Explication.

*The value of this tagging system lies in demonstrating that the future lies not in replacing humans with AI, but in their symbiosis, based on complementary strengths.*
