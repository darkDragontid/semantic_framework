### Meta-Layer: Interpretation and Ontological Rule

This section describes a prospective direction for the system's development, elevating it to the level of a formal ontology of personal knowledge. The implementation of this layer represents a separate complex task and is a subject for further research.

The Problem of Multidimensional Interpretation

The base system operates with the theme/focus pair as the primary tool for interpretation. However, a single note can be understood from several fundamentally different perspectives.

_Example:_
- A note about a broken promise can be interpreted from:

- A functional perspective: theme: obligation_management / focus: deadline_miss

- A psychological perspective: theme: interpersonal_conflict / focus: breach_of_trust

An ethical perspective: theme: moral_responsibility / focus: consequences_of_choice

The Concept of an "Interpretation Container"

To support such multidimensionality, the introduction of a meta-field called interpretation is proposed. It acts as a container for various theme/focus pairs, each linked to a specific perspective.

Container structure (hypothetical):

_yaml_

interpretation:
  - perspective: "psychological"
    - theme: "interpersonal_conflict"
    - focus: "breach_of_trust"
  - perspective: "functional"
    - theme: "obligation_management"
    - focus: "deadline_miss"

The interpretation meta-layer does not replace the domain, category, theme, and focus fields. It is built on top of them, acting as their "manager" or "director," handling their multiplicity and linking them to a point of view (perspective).

#### The Problem:

The category field (or the activity_type/content_type pair) describes the note as a whole. But if a note has multiple interpretations, its "type" can change drastically depending on the perspective.

_Example:_ A note about a painting can be:

- From an art criticism perspective: content_type: analysis

- From a psychological perspective: content_type: reflection

- From a technical perspective: content_type: instruction (about painting technique)

What should be put in the "main" field? If we choose one, we lose information. If we put everything at once, the field turns into a junk drawer.

_Solution: A Two-Level Categorization Model_

We "push down" the specific categories to the interpretation level, leaving only the most general, invariant characteristic in the "global" fields.

#### Global Level (for the entire note): category_type

- Purpose: To define the most general, formal genre of the note, independent of its content and interpretations.

- Values: Highly generalized, e.g., reasoning, description, instruction, question, summary, biography.

- Criterion: "What is this text in terms of its form?"

#### Interpretation Level (for each perspective): activity_type / content_type

- Purpose: To define the type of activity and result precisely within the framework of this specific interpretation.

- Values: Those very detailed lists we discussed (analysis, synthesis, idea, hypothesis, etc.).

- Criterion: "What was I doing and what was the result from this particular point of view?"

_The YAML formatting is preserved as it is a hypothetical code example integral to the explanation._
