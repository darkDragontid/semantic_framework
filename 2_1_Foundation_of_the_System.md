### Foundation of the System

The central element of the system is a unit of meaning, formalized as a stable concept.

A Concept is a basic, machine-readable unit of meaning representing a holistic, stable, and semantically indivisible notion extracted from text and normalized for reuse.

#### Properties of a Concept:

1. Holism: It forms a new, emergent meaning that cannot be reduced to the simple sum of its parts (e.g., social_dynamics ≠ social + dynamics).
2. Stability (Invariance): Its meaning is stable and independent of the context of use.
3. Semantic Indivisibility (Atomicity): It cannot be broken down into smaller, independent units of meaning within the system without losing its relevant significance.
4. Machine-Readability: It is represented in a strict format that ensures its unambiguous identification, searchability, and ability to be linked by algorithms.
5. Reusability: It serves as a "building block" for forming complex semantic structures in various contexts.

#### The Nature of a Concept is a synthesis of three representations:

- Computational (Machine-Readability): A concept is data. The strictness of tag formation ensures stability for the system.
- Cognitive (Thought-Readability): A concept is a unit of thought. It corresponds to a holistic mental image or schema in human consciousness.
- Linguistic (Linguistic Form): A concept is a linguistic sign. It is based on a natural language phenomenon—a stable word combination that has been filtered and normalized.

Thus, the system does not create meaning out of nothing. It is a mechanism for detecting, refining, and formalizing those holistic units of meaning that already exist in language and thought, transforming them into stable concepts for human-AI symbiosis.
