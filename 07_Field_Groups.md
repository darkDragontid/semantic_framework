#### Field Groups

Based on the Principle of Semantic Distribution, the fields are divided into the following groups according to their role in the process of interpretation and meaning processing.

#### 1. Fundamental Classifiers (Rigid Framework)

These fields set the most general, categorical context. Their values are selected from fixed lists. They are ontologically primary.

- domain (Domain) — The broadest context (e.g., "Science", "Experience").

- category (Category) — Type of activity or format (e.g., "Analysis", "Project").

Purpose: To create rigid anchor points for navigation and machine analysis. Answers the question: "To which world and which type of activity does this belong?"

#### 2. Interpretation Core (Strict Semantic Units)

Fields for semantic decomposition. This is where machine-readable abstractions are created. They follow the strictest linguistic rules.

- theme (Object) — A broad area, problem field.

- focus (Subject) — A specific aspect within the theme.

- related (Connections) — Deep, implicit concepts.

Purpose: To answer interpretation questions: "How to understand this?" (theme/focus) and "What deep ideas is this connected to?" (related). This is the "brain" of the system.

#### 3. Semantic Descriptors (Flexible Description)

Fields for describing the content of a note from different angles. Their rules are less strict, providing a connection to natural language.

- keywords (Keywords) — Explicitly mentioned objects.

- operation (Operation) — The mental operation performed on the information.

- emotion (Emotion) — The emotional background.

- context (Context) — The circumstances described in the text.

Purpose: To answer the questions: "What is happening here?" They add flesh and blood to the semantic framework created by the core.

#### 4. Utilitarian-Service Fields (External Meta-Information)

Fields that do not carry semantic load about the note's content. They manage the process of working with it.

- meta_context (Meta-context) — The circumstances of the note's creation.

- action (Action) — Management notes for the owner.

- components (Components) — A service field for machine decomposition.

Purpose: To answer the questions: "How and when was this created?" and "What to do with this?". This is the "instrument panel" for management, not for interpretation.
