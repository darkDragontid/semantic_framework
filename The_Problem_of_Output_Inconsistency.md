### The Problem of Output Inconsistency

Output inconsistency occurs when the same AI model generates different tags, connections, or interpretations for the same note upon repeated queries. This introduces chaos into PKM systems, disrupting tag coherence, synonym handling, and the structure of relationship graphs.

#### Detailed Explanation:
The problem of output inconsistency stems from the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Even when using the same model, results vary due to the following reasons:

- **Probabilistic word selection:** LLMs generate output by selecting words or phrases based on probabilities. Even with a fixed prompt (e.g., "Generate a tag for this note"), the model may choose different synonyms or interpretations due to random sampling (e.g., the "temperature" parameter in models).
- **Context sensitivity:** Models account for internal context or "noise" (e.g., random variations in token processing), leading to different interpretations of the same note.
- **Impact of watermarks and filters (especially in cloud models):** As you rightly noted, watermarks (or hidden filters in cloud models like OpenAI) can alter output, making words "different" from a machine’s perspective. This exacerbates inconsistency, as the model might replace "AI" with "technology" due to proprietary settings.

#### Consequences for PKM:
- **Breakdown of tag coherence:** Different tags for the same note (e.g., `obligation_management` vs. `interpersonal_conflict`)破坏系统的一致性。
- **Chaotic relationship graphs:** If tags are inconsistent, the `relate` field (implicit connections) becomes unreliable, and the graph in PKM tools (e.g., Obsidian) loses accuracy.
- **Synonym issues:** Without normalization (as in your dynamic dictionary), synonyms (e.g., "AI" vs. "artificial_intelligence") are interpreted as distinct entities, worsening the chaos.

#### How This System Addresses the Problem:
This system minimizes inconsistency through:
- **Strict tagging rules (section "Tag Formation Principles"):** The adjective_noun format and prohibition of prepositions/verbs limit tag variability.
- **Dynamic dictionary (section "Dynamic Dictionary"):** Normalizes synonyms (e.g., "AI" → "artificial_intelligence"), eliminating random substitutions.
- **Interpretation field:** Captures perspectives (e.g., functional, psychological), guiding the model toward predictable tags.
- **Local models:** Using localized models eliminates the impact of cloud-based filters that amplify inconsistency.
