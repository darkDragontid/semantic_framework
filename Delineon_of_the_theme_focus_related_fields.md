### Delineation of the theme/focus and related fields

#### A) The theme field (Object / Context / Problem Field)

Purpose: To define the broad semantic area, subject area, or context to which the core meaning of the note belongs. This is the space in which a problem, idea, or event exists.

Semantics: Answers the question: "Within the framework of what?" It is the area of consideration, not the subject itself.

Criteria:

- A broad, stable phenomenon, a category of knowledge or human experience.

- Not a specific event, name, or action.

- Forms the background and sets the coordinate system for interpretation.

#### B) The focus field (Subject / Aspect / Perspective)

Purpose: To highlight a specific aspect, angle, problem, or object within the area defined by the theme. This is the focal point of attention within the general context.

Semantics: Answers the question: "What exactly, within this framework?" It is a focal statement or a unique point of view.

Criteria:

- Always semantically subordinate to the theme and is interpreted only in conjunction with it.

- Concrete and precise, often unique to this particular note.

- Is the very "grain" of a thought or insight.

#### C) The related field (Connections / Conceptual Framework)

Purpose: To denote fundamental, implicit concepts, theories, or semantic structures that are critically important for understanding the note but are not necessarily explicitly mentioned in it. This is the hidden framework on which the thought relies.

Semantics: Answers the question: "What deep ideas is this connected to?" It is the theoretical or philosophical foundation.

Criteria:

- Does not duplicate keywords (explicit mentions) or theme/focus (main context and object).

- These are abstract, universal categories applicable in different contexts.

- Serves to build semantic bridges between heterogeneous notes.
