### Glossary

#### A. Fundamental Principles and Concepts

***Semantic Framework***: A formalized tagging system designed to turn unstructured text into a machine-readable hierarchy of semantic units. The foundation for symbiosis with AI.

***Architectural Distribution of Complexity***: A meta-principle stating that the complexity and strictness of tags are architecturally predetermined by the semantic role of each field in the overall structure.

***Differential Strictness***: The principle of applying linguistic rules with varying degrees of rigidity depending on the field level (atomic, strict, moderate, pragmatic).

#### B. Key System Principles

***Principle of Semantic Distribution***: Every element of meaning must be consciously placed in the field intended for it.

***Principle of Contextual Dependency***: The theme and focus fields are not rigid labels and depend on the perspective from which the note is considered.

***Principle of Multiple Interpretation***: A single note can be assigned several theme/focus pairs, representing different perspectives of its content.

***Principle of Permissible Emptiness***: If there is insufficient information to fill a field, it must remain empty.

#### C. Linguistic Principles (Tag Formation Principles)

***Principle of Atomic Purity***: The requirement to use only atomic (single-word) tags for the operation and emotion fields.

***Principle of Machine-Readable Abstraction*** The requirement to use the Adj_Noun/Noun_Noun format and the prohibition of prepositions/verbs for the theme, focus, and related fields.

***Principle of Contextual Flexibility***: Permission to use set phrases with prepositions for the keywords and context fields.

***Principle of Pragmatic Usefulness***: Permission for any formats for the utilitarian fields action and meta_context.

#### D. Critical Technological Concepts

***Dynamic Dictionary***: A mechanism that ensures tag consistency by mapping user synonyms to canonical forms stored in the system.

***Canonical Form*** The single, strictly normalized form of a tag (e.g., artificial_intelligence) used for storage and analysis.

***Interpretation Layer***: A hypothetical meta-level of the system designed to group theme/focus pairs under different perspectives (perspective) to describe the multidimensionality of a note.

***AI Symbiosis***: The target mode of system operation where the main load of semantic analysis and pre-filling fields falls on an AI assistant, and the user's role is reduced to curation and verification.
